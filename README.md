# Dot net core 3.1 REST API - Layerd architecture

Ready to start boiler plates for .net core 3.1 REST API with layered architecture and repository pattern.

# Introduction

This repo is part of a mission to build ready to start boilerplate for dot net core REST API with different architecture and all essential goodies for production ready code.
This one is a version of layered architecture with Repository pattern and entity framework. I am following the pattern of micro service and creating individual micro-APIâ€™s which can be scalable independently.

I still beleive there are scenarios for building REST API using the layered architecture and this has relevance.
